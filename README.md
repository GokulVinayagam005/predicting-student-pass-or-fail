# Student Performance Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📘 Project Overview

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on two key factors:

- Hours Studied
- Attendance Percentage

This is a simple binary classification problem aimed at beginners learning machine learning concepts.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning model that:
- Trains on a small dataset of students
- Predicts pass/fail outcomes (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail)
- Visualizes the relationship between study features and performance

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## 📂 Dataset Format

The dataset includes:
- `Hours_Studied`
- `Attendance (%)`
- `Pass/Fail` (1 or 0)

Example:

| Hours_Studied | Attendance | Pass/Fail |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| 5             | 85         | 1         |
| 2             | 60         | 0         |
| 4             | 75         | 1         |
| 1             | 50         | 0         |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the notebook or Python file in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Run each cell step-by-step.
4. Try predicting with custom inputs using `.predict()`.
